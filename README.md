# Origin Product Take-Home Assignment

## The Assignment
Write an analysis of your *new* favorite product.

We expect you to go in-depth on at least the following questions:

- What is it?
- What it does and why do you love it?
- What are its top 1-2 features? Why? Why were they implemented? How would you measure their success?
- Same thing for the worst 1-2 features.
- How would you improve it? Why is that important? What's the effect you expect it to be? Consider you'd have 2 months with 1 designer and 2 engineers.

## Criteria
We are looking for intellectually rigorous, relentless resourceful, detail-obsessed, customer-centric, technically excellent product leaders.

Given that you show those qualities in your analysis, you can deliver it in any form you like, as long as you use English. We'd prefer it if you send us a text file, but it's just that – a preference. If you'd rather do a PowerPoint presentation or a web page, go for it.

This assignment should be doable in less than one day. We expect you to learn fast, communicate with us, and make decisions regarding its implementation & scope to achieve the expected results on time.

Feel free to add mockups if it helps you during the process, but it is not necessary to build any-fidelity screens a user would interact with. We have a strong design team, so this won't be a part of your day-to-day.

## OBAWINE
Obawine is a platform to buy wines in lots importing directly from any winery in the word. I love it because enable people to get together to buy wines at prices that would be impractical by traditional purchasing channels. At the same time, wineries increase their sales of products with higher added value selling directly to customers.
### Vision
Incredible wines must be accessible and enjoyed by many people. 
### Value Propositions
1. offer customers the possibility to buy any wine from anywhere in the world.
2. customers are sure to be paying the cheapest price.

### What is problem solving ?
Wines imported into Brazil are very expensive, discouraging the consumption of more qualitative wines. The platform offers an innovative solution, Shared Direct Import, reducing the final price to customers. 

### Top 2 features
1. Customers can suggest import wines they love that are not currently being offered in the catalog or by other stores or e-commerces.  This feature are implemented to differentiate the platform from other e-commerces that offer only products from the catalog because in the discovery process many customers reported the desire to buy exclusives wines that are not on the market. The success of this feature would be measure by the sales made by suggestion compared to total sales (at least 20%) for the firts periode that will be analyzed and reach at least 70% in the nexts weeks. Other hipotheses need to be validated if the feature was unsuccessful and few customers suggest new wines. For example, what percentage of users are aware of this functionality? Another data that must be validated is the total of closed lots (effective orders) made by suggested products not offered in the catalog. The fact that it has many suggestions but that do not generate effective sales, is a sign that the feature of suggesting wines was not successful. 
What can be improved: The time to process and register a new wine suggested. 
2. Price comparison (under implementation). As customers buy in lots (minimum 6 bottles), is important they are sure to be paying the cheapest price. Why buy in lots not knowing I'am paying the best price ? Customers need to know, need to see prices from others stores in the time of purchase. This feature would be measure by the number of clicks made on the price comparison button (at least 80% of buyers), this can also validate if a price for the customers is a decisive buying factor in the market of qualitatives wines.
What can be improved: Increase the data base of stores to compare prices

### Worst feature
Customers can buy wines of differents lots (wine labels), but currently the purchase of different lots is treated as separate orders even if the purchase is made on the same order. This is because some lots may not be closed. To be closed, the lot must reach a minimum amount of bottles sold. This process can confuse the customer. This feature was implemented because there is no other solution that solves the problem for the current business model. 

### How I would improve it
Performing an effective discovery process. The most important thing in this process is involve the team so that they do their best. They need to understand the business context and where the company is heading. The project need to be measured by the problems solved. With the team we will decide together features that need to be implemented to solve problems. A tool that I like to work is The Objectives and Key Results (OKR) that it needs to be aligned with the team. 

### OKR Proposal - for the nexts 2 months

Objective 1: Improve the processes to register a new wine suggested
Key Results: a) Reduce the time to register a new wine from 4 days for 2 days
             b) increase the database of wineries by country in 30%
             c) Implement new feature: wine suggestion ideas to customers by analyzing their purchase profile
             
Objective 2: Double the daily traffic of users
Key Results: a) Engage current customers to invite friends to visit the platform in 10%
             b) improve the search tool by implementing at least 3 more features
             c) Implement a tool for virtual events between consumers and producers, with 2 weekly meetings
